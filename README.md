# Discord-Spoiler-Cog-For-Redbot
Spoiler cog that works with the discord redbot that allows user to spoiler images on mobile by typing the command !spoiler when they upload an image. The bot will reupload the image spoilered and it will delete the originally sent image. If no image is attached to the sent message an error message will display asking for an image to be sent.
